# Vault

Vault is a simple demonstration of how to utilized UUIDs as primary keys in the database and encrypt sensitive data on a database column.  This demonstration also includes a simply policy to prevent unauthorized users from seeing encrypted data that they did not enter into the system.  Vault, in the simplest form, is just an encrypted storage to house passwords and credit card information, but could easily be added on to include files and other types of sensitive information.
